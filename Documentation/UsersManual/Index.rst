Choosing a Storage Folder for Website Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for Website Users to be able to log in, the felogin plugin
must know where the records are stored. There are three possibilities
for setting this storage folder:

- Go to the page where the felogin plugin exists and edit the page
  properties, setting the field for the "General Record Storage Page" to
  your storage folder.

- Or edit the felogin plugin, setting the field for the "User Storage
  Page" to your storage folder.

- Or set the UID of you storage folder through TypoScript in the setup
  field of your TypoScript Template:

::

   plugin.tx_felogin_pi1.storagePid = xxx
